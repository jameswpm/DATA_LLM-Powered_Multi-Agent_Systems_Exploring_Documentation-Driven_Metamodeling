# Manual Baseline

Expert-created reference artifacts for comparison. Not treated as ground truth, but as a human-crafted baseline.

## Source

Adapted from the metamodel in:

> Miranda, J. P.; Radermacher, A.; Baligand, F.; Bonnail, J.; Gérard, S.; Bannerot, P. and Fabro, M. D. (2026). *Bridging MDE and LLM-Based Agent Frameworks for Multi-Agent Systems: A Quasi-Systematic Review and Metamodel.* MODELSWARD 2026, pp. 33-44.

## Adaptation

The original metamodel (developed in Emfatic/EMF) was manually translated to PlantUML to enable direct comparison with generated artifacts.

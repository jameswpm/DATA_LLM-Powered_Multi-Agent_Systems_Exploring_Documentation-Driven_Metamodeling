Act as a specialist in code-first agentic frameworks that knows about conceptual modeling and metamodeling. We have high level of knowledge in PlantUML as a tool for early metamodels.


Create a **PlantUML class diagram** that represents a coherent metamodel of AI agent framework concepts based on your own knowledge.

The diagram should capture:
- **Core entities** (classes) representing framework concepts
- **Relationships** between entities (associations, compositions, inheritance)
- **Attributes** derived from term definitions
- **Logical grouping** using packages (e.g., "construction" vs. "communication" concerns)

# Follow the step-by-step process:
1. **Identify Core Concepts**: List the main entities in AI agent frameworks (e.g., Agent, Environment, Task, Action, Sensor, etc.).
2. **Define Relationships**: Determine how these entities relate to each other (e.g., Agent performs Action, Agent perceives Environment through Sensor).
3. **Add Attributes**: For each entity, identify key attributes that capture essential properties (e.g., Agent might have attributes like "name", "capabilities", "goals").
4. **Organize with Packages**: Group related entities into packages to reflect different concerns (e.g., "Agent Architecture", "Interaction", "Environment Modeling").

Your response should be a valid PlantUML class diagram syntax that can be rendered by PlantUML tools. Focus on clarity and coherence in representing the metamodel of AI agent frameworks.
